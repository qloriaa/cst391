# God's Wisdom Online Bookshop App

## Description:

The application I will be developing for this course is an Online Bookshop. The online shop named “God's Wisdom” will include various books that focus on learning more about the wisdom of God for all types of readers. The shop is intended to have faith and self-help books, and other aspects of Christian Core values. The application is intended to be easy to use and will focus on user experience.
