Research the Vue.js framework. Provide one to two advantages and one to two disadvantages of using it. Justify your rationale with reliable and valid information.

- We have been researching about React and Angular as two of the most popular javascript frameworks, but Vue.js is also a popular framework. Vue is appreciated for its flexibility and efficiency. The Elitex team, a front-end development company, compares the syntax "very familiar to React developers, as these languages share many common features" (elitex). Vue has a component-based architecture making code highly reusable. It is a great framework for fast development and it has a smaller ecosystem than Angular and React while still offering useful libraries, plugins, and tools. Making Vue more approachable, it has an easier learning curve in comparison to other frameworks.
As I mentioned, Vue is one of the most popular frameworks but it is still behind Angular and React in marketability and programmer acceptance, so there is a lack of experienced users. VueJS is also funded and maintained by developer and lacks the funding of big companies that other frameworks have. Additionally, Vue was initially developed in China and there is some language constraints/barriers when accessing documentation or forums. As a newer framework, it has a smaller community and still has compatibility issues.

Research what a Javascript framework is and how does it differ from programming in standard Javascript. Explain the motivations for learning a Javascript framework.

- A JavaScript framework is a collection of JS code libraries providing pre-written code for basic or common programming tasks. In an article by Multiverse, they mentioned a StackOverflow study demonstrated that 66% of professional developers use JavaScript (multiverse, 2023). In that same article they mention that a programmer can learn JS basics if they practice everyday for three to six months, and it would take years to master. I have read that JavaScript can be challenging ot learn. Programming in pure JavaScript can be tedious and take very long to create basic code. We need JavaScript because is a powerful language that is used in both front-end and back-end development (General Assembly, 2024). This is where JS frameworks come in! A benefit of using frameworks is that they bring rules and guidelines to allow a developer to create complex applications fast and efficiently. Some frameworks like Angular force a structural patterns which benefit the application's code reusability, scalability and maintainability, reducing errors and improving performance. In short, a JS framework is a full tool set that helps shape and organize your website or application. Coding in JS without a framework can be more challenging, tedious, repetitive, and disorganized.

Research three popular Javascript frameworks. Give examples of which companies or well-known applications are using them. What is the growth projection for each company and/or application? Gather data about the frameworks from job postings on Indeed.com or other online job boards. What can you deduce from your research?

- **Angular:**
 It is framework for front-end applications with the use of HTML and TypeScript. It promotes component-based architecture which can make is a good choice for large complex applications. Being able to develop SPAs, and build reusabl components make it easy to develop, read, and test.
    - **Who Uses it?**
    1. Google
    2. Forbes
    3. Gmail
    4. YouTube TV
    5. The Weather Channel

    - **Growth Projection?**
    Angular is a powerful all-round framework that has much to offer. It is a strong framework to use when building large complex applications. Angular is a framework that will remain popular for the forseeable future. 

- **VueJS:**
 It is a small framework that is easy to understand and code. Only HTML, CSS, and JS basic are required to learn. Its single-file components make applications more readable and maintainable.
    - **Who Uses it?**
    1. Facebook
    2. Netflix
    3. Adobe
    4. GitLab
    5. Nintendo

    - **Growth Projection?** 
    Although it is not as popular as Angular and React, it has been growing in popularity over the last years. It is likely to continue to grow as it has a large community behind it.

- **React:**
 React is technically a library, which allow developers the ability to choose their development tools. This flexibility allows for greater customization and creativity in the development process.
    - **Who Uses it?**
    1. Facebook (NewsFeed)
    2. Instagram
    3. Reddit
    4. GitHub
    5. PayPal

    - **Growth Projection?** 
    React.js has become a go-to choice for many companies looking to build robust and interactive web applications (Artoon, 2023). It is a framework that offers simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility. It is the most popular framework, and that is not likely going to change soon.

While completing the activity this week, reflect on the final product and resources you have used. How do you see this preparing you for your chosen field? 

- After completing Activity 7, I realized that I need a lot more practice in using both frameworks. I had mentioned that I thought it was important for professional growth and marketability to pursue proficiency in both frameworks, and I stand by it; although, it will definitely be harder than I originally thought. I was glad to be able to noticed many of the differences between React and Angular, aside from their structure. React did not require separate files, everything that was needed for a specific component/object/form was could all neatly be included in a single js file. This was definitely different from the MVC structure I have learned to appreciate. The lack of structure, at times, made it more difficult to follow the code. With my knowledge of React right now, I don't know if I could efficiently bring some sort of structure to the application. This has been the most stressful milestone project I have had. I took so long researching routing, watched many tutorials, and reviewed the study guides, but I could not find my routing issue. In a way, this course was a humbling experience knowing exactly what my issue is and not being able to fix it. These projects have definitely made me write and rewrite the code in several ways, since there are several ways to accomplish routing. I think the whole experience is rewarding as well, as I learned more about what the framework has to offer beyond what we where introduced in class.

If presented with a problem or challenge, how confident are you that this course has equipped you with the skills to appropriately respond? If a particular topic has not been covered, to what extent has this course equipped you with the ability to expand your knowledge by learning on your own? 

- As mentioned in a previous reply, the challenges I have come across in the development of these applications has led me into rabbit hole in both the Angular and React documentation and tutorials. I don't know if I can overcome the challenges of creating larger applications with either of these frameworks with the knowledge I have right now. However, I do have more confidence in researching for solutions in the community. The applications we created in this course were basic but they introduced us to API connectivity and routing, which is something I had never done before. The my previous web applications had db connectivity, back-end, and front-end code all in one. Working with json files, I also saw tutorials of connecting Angular to mongoDB service and how to set those up. That is something that sparked my curiosity and see how that may change the way my application is layed out.
